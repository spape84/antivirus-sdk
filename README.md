# Antivirus Plugins for Kerio Products

Antivirus plugins for Kerio products are used for communication between Kerio products (Kerio Connect, Kerio Control) and external antivirus program.

## Supported versions and platforms

We successfully compiled it on Debian GNU/Linux 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)

* Kerio Connect 7.1 and newer

## Content

* `api/` -- The API a plugin must implement
* `clam/` -- ClamAV plugin
* `sample/` -- Skeleton of a new plugin

## How to compile

* Get CMake build tool.

			apt-get install cmake        
    
* Get Boost libraries. (Only for ClamAV plugin, not needed for sample.)

			apt-get install libboost-all-dev        

   **NOTE:** We tested versions 1.55
 
* Run `cmake .` inside plugin's source directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` resides) -- in `clam/` or in `sample/`.
* Build binary using `make`.

## Installation

Once you compile the plugin (`avir_*.so`), copy it to `/opt/kerio/mailserver/plugin/avserver/avirs/` and run the administration console. You may want to change the default settings in (`Antivirus -> Select antivirus... -> Options...`). Then start the plugin in the administration console.

See [ClamAV Kerio KB article](http://kb.kerio.com/article.php?id=282) for further instructions.
